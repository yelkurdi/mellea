# diataxis: tutorial
---

In this tutorial you build a document analysis pipeline that extracts a summary,
classifies sentiment, and surfaces key issues from customer feedback. You start
with the simplest possible Mellea program and add reliability and structure at each
step.

By the end you will have covered:

- `instruct()` with user variables and requirements
- Rejection sampling and `SamplingResult`
- Composing generative functions into a pipeline

> **`@generative` in depth:** This tutorial uses `@generative` in the final pipeline
> step. For a dedicated walkthrough of typed returns, `Literal`, and Pydantic models,
> see [Tutorial 03: Using Generative Stubs](../tutorials/03-using-generative-stubs).

**Prerequisites:** [Quick Start](../getting-started/quickstart) complete,
Mellea installed (`uv add mellea`), Ollama running locally with `granite4.1:3b` downloaded.

---

## Step 1: One instruction

Start with the smallest possible program: a single call to `instruct()`.

```python
# Requires: mellea
# Returns: str
import mellea

m = mellea.start_session()
summary = m.instruct(
    "Summarise this customer feedback in one sentence: "
    "The onboarding was confusing and took far too long. "
    "Support was helpful once I got through."
)
print(str(summary))
```

```text Sample output
The initial experience with the product's onboarding process was
challenging but support staff provided valuable assistance later.
```

> **Note:** LLM output is non-deterministic. Your result will vary in wording.

`instruct()` returns a [`ModelOutputThunk`](../reference/glossary#modeloutputthunk). Calling `str()` on it (or accessing
`.value`) gives you the string. This is already a generative program: it calls an
LLM and returns structured text.

The problem is reliability. The model might return two sentences, or three, or
include a preamble. Move to the next step to enforce the format.

---

## Step 2: Adding user variables

Hardcoding the text in the instruction string makes the function impossible to reuse.
Use `user_variables` and `{{double_braces}}` template syntax:

```python
# Requires: mellea
# Returns: str
import mellea

def summarize_feedback(m: mellea.MelleaSession, text: str) -> str:
    result = m.instruct(
        "Summarise this customer feedback in one sentence: {{text}}",
        user_variables={"text": text},
    )
    return str(result)


m = mellea.start_session()
feedback = (
    "The onboarding was confusing and took far too long. "
    "Support was helpful once I got through."
)
print(summarize_feedback(m, feedback))
```

```text Sample output
The onboarding process was complicated and time-consuming, but the
support team proved to be highly beneficial upon successful connection.
```

> **Note:** LLM output is non-deterministic. Your result will vary in wording, but should be a single sentence.

The description is now a [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) template. Variables are rendered at generation time,
not embedded in the source code.

---

## Step 3: Enforcing constraints with requirements

Pass a list of plain-English requirements to constrain the output. Mellea checks
each requirement after generation and retries if any fail:

```python
# Requires: mellea
# Returns: str
import mellea

def summarize_feedback(m: mellea.MelleaSession, text: str) -> str:
    result = m.instruct(
        "Summarise this customer feedback in one sentence: {{text}}",
        requirements=[
            "The summary must be a single sentence.",
            "Include both positive and negative aspects if both are present.",
        ],
        user_variables={"text": text},
    )
    return str(result)


m = mellea.start_session()
feedback = (
    "The onboarding was confusing and took far too long. "
    "Support was helpful once I got through."
)
print(summarize_feedback(m, feedback))
```

```text Sample output
The onboarding process was confusing and time-consuming, but the
support team proved to be very helpful upon successful completion
of the initial steps.
```

> **Note:** LLM output is non-deterministic. Your result will vary in wording, but should be a single sentence capturing both the negative and positive aspects.

Requirements are validated by LLM-as-a-judge by default. If a requirement fails,
Mellea sends the model the failure reason and asks it to repair the output.

---

## Step 4: Deterministic validation

For facts you can check in code — word counts, format, length — use
`simple_validate`:

```python
# Requires: mellea
# Returns: str
import mellea
from mellea.stdlib.requirements import req, simple_validate

def summarize_feedback(m: mellea.MelleaSession, text: str) -> str:
    result = m.instruct(
        "Summarise this customer feedback in one sentence: {{text}}",
        requirements=[
            req(
                "The summary must be a single sentence.",
            ),
            req(
                "Fewer than 30 words.",
                validation_fn=simple_validate(
                    lambda x: (
                        len(x.split()) < 30,
                        f"Summary has {len(x.split())} words; must be under 30.",
                    )
                ),
            ),
        ],
        user_variables={"text": text},
    )
    return str(result)


m = mellea.start_session()
feedback = (
    "The onboarding was confusing and took far too long. "
    "Support was helpful once I got through."
)
print(summarize_feedback(m, feedback))
```

```text Sample output
Onboarding was confusing and lengthy, but support was helpful after
issues were resolved.
```

> **Note:** LLM output is non-deterministic. Your result will vary in wording, but should be a single sentence capturing fewer than 30 words.

The word-count check is deterministic: it runs in microseconds. The "single
sentence" check is left for LLM-as-a-judge since counting sentences is harder
to code reliably.

---

## Step 5: Rejection sampling and inspecting results

By default, `instruct()` retries up to twice if any requirement fails. Use
[`RejectionSamplingStrategy`](../reference/glossary#sampling-strategy) to control the budget and inspect results:

```python
# Requires: mellea
# Returns: str
import mellea
from mellea.stdlib.requirements import req, simple_validate
from mellea.stdlib.sampling import RejectionSamplingStrategy

def summarize_feedback(m: mellea.MelleaSession, text: str) -> str:
    result = m.instruct(
        "Summarise this customer feedback in one sentence: {{text}}",
        requirements=[
            req(
                "Fewer than 30 words.",
                validation_fn=simple_validate(
                    lambda x: (
                        len(x.split()) < 30,
                        f"Summary has {len(x.split())} words; must be under 30.",
                    )
                ),
            ),
        ],
        strategy=RejectionSamplingStrategy(loop_budget=5),
        user_variables={"text": text},
        return_sampling_results=True,
    )

    if result.success:
        return str(result.result)
    else:
        # All attempts failed — use the first generation anyway
        print(f"Warning: failed after {len(result.sample_generations)} attempts")
        return str(result.sample_generations[0].value)


m = mellea.start_session()
print(summarize_feedback(m, "The onboarding was confusing and took far too long."))
```

```text Sample output
Onboarding process was found confusing and overly prolonged by customers.
```

> **Note:** LLM output is non-deterministic. Your result will vary in wording, but should be a single sentence fewer than 30 words.

With `return_sampling_results=True`, `instruct()` returns a [`SamplingResult`](../reference/glossary#samplingresult) with
`.success`, `.result`, and `.sample_generations`. This gives you programmatic
control over what to do when the model can not satisfy your requirements.

---

## Step 6: Composing the pipeline

Assemble all the pieces into a complete pipeline:

```python
# Requires: mellea, pydantic
# Returns: None
from typing import Literal
from pydantic import BaseModel

from mellea import MelleaSession, generative, start_session
from mellea.stdlib.requirements import req, simple_validate
from mellea.stdlib.sampling import RejectionSamplingStrategy


class FeedbackIssues(BaseModel):
    main_complaint: str
    positive_aspect: str | None
    urgency: str


@generative
def classify_sentiment(summary: str) -> Literal["positive", "negative", "mixed"]:
    """Classify the overall sentiment of the customer feedback summary."""


@generative
def extract_issues(feedback: str) -> FeedbackIssues:
    """Extract the main complaint, any positive aspect, and urgency from the feedback."""


def summarize_feedback(m: MelleaSession, text: str) -> str:
    result = m.instruct(
        "Summarise this customer feedback in one sentence: {{text}}",
        requirements=[
            req(
                "Fewer than 30 words.",
                validation_fn=simple_validate(
                    lambda x: (
                        len(x.split()) < 30,
                        f"Summary is {len(x.split())} words; must be under 30.",
                    )
                ),
            ),
        ],
        strategy=RejectionSamplingStrategy(loop_budget=5),
        user_variables={"text": text},
        return_sampling_results=True,
    )
    if result.success:
        return str(result.result)
    return str(result.sample_generations[0].value)


def analyze_feedback(feedback: str) -> None:
    m = start_session()

    summary = summarize_feedback(m, feedback)
    sentiment = classify_sentiment(m, summary=summary)
    issues = extract_issues(m, feedback=feedback)

    print(f"Summary:   {summary}")
    print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment}")
    print(f"Complaint: {issues.main_complaint}")
    print(f"Positive:  {issues.positive_aspect}")
    print(f"Urgency:   {issues.urgency}")


analyze_feedback(
    "The onboarding was confusing and took far too long. "
    "Support was helpful once I got through."
)
```

```text Sample output
Summary:   Onboarding was confusing and lengthy, but support was
           helpful after contact.
Sentiment: mixed
Complaint: onboarding was confusing and took far too long
Positive:  Support was helpful once I got through
Urgency:   not mentioned
```

> **Note:** LLM output is non-deterministic. Wording will vary, but `Sentiment` will be one of `positive`, `negative`, or `mixed`, and `FeedbackIssues` fields will be populated strings.

Each step in the pipeline is an independent LLM call with a typed interface. The
output of `summarize_feedback` feeds `classify_sentiment`; the original feedback
feeds `extract_issues`. There is no global state, no prompt accumulation — each
call is self-contained.
