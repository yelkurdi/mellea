# diataxis: tutorial

This tutorial shows how to build composable LLM-backed functions using the
[`@generative`](../reference/glossary#generative) decorator — functions with typed return values, docstring-driven
prompts, and consistent behaviour that you can reuse across a codebase.

By the end you will have covered:

- Defining `@generative` functions with typed returns
- Composing multiple generative functions into a pipeline
- Controlling behaviour via [`ChatContext`](../reference/glossary#chatcontext) and context injection
- Precondition and postcondition validation patterns

**Prerequisites:** [Tutorial 01](./01-your-first-generative-program) complete,
`pip install mellea`, Ollama running locally with `granite4.1:3b` downloaded.

---

## Step 1: Your first @generative function

A `@generative` function uses its name, type annotation, and docstring as the
prompt. Call it by passing a `MelleaSession` as the first argument:

```python
# Requires: mellea
# Returns: str
import mellea
from mellea import generative

@generative
def classify_sentiment(text: str) -> str:
    """Classify the sentiment of the text as 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral'."""

m = mellea.start_session()
result = classify_sentiment(m, text="The product arrived damaged and support ignored me.")
print(str(result))
```

```text Sample output
negative
```

> **Note:** Output may vary — LLM responses depend on model and temperature.

The return type annotation shapes the output. With `-> str`, the model returns
free text. For constrained output, use `Literal`:

```python
from typing import Literal
from mellea import generative

@generative
def classify_sentiment(text: str) -> Literal["positive", "negative", "neutral"]: ...
```

Now the output is guaranteed to be one of those three strings.

## Step 2: Typed and structured returns

Generative functions support any JSON-serialisable return type — `str`, `int`,
`bool`, `list`, `dict`, and Pydantic models:

```python
# Requires: mellea, pydantic
# Returns: FeedbackAnalysis
from typing import Literal

import mellea
from mellea import generative
from pydantic import BaseModel

class FeedbackAnalysis(BaseModel):
    sentiment: Literal["positive", "negative", "neutral"]
    key_issue: str
    actionable: bool

@generative
def analyse_feedback(text: str) -> FeedbackAnalysis:
    """Extract sentiment, the main issue, and whether it is actionable."""

m = mellea.start_session()
result = analyse_feedback(
    m,
    text="The onboarding took two hours and nothing was explained clearly.",
)
print(result.sentiment, result.key_issue, result.actionable)
```

```text Sample output
negative unclear onboarding process True
```

> **Note:** With a Pydantic return type, `result` is a validated `FeedbackAnalysis` instance. `result.sentiment` will always be one of `"positive"`, `"negative"`, or `"neutral"`.

The return value is a validated `FeedbackAnalysis` instance. If the model output
doesn't conform, Mellea retries.

## Step 3: Compose generative functions

Because each `@generative` function is just a Python function, you compose them
the same way as any other code:

```python
# Requires: mellea
# Returns: str
from typing import Literal

import mellea
from mellea import generative
from pydantic import BaseModel

class FeedbackAnalysis(BaseModel):
    sentiment: Literal["positive", "negative", "neutral"]
    key_issue: str
    actionable: bool

@generative
def analyse_feedback(text: str) -> FeedbackAnalysis:
    """Extract sentiment, the main issue, and whether it is actionable."""

@generative
def draft_response(issue: str) -> str:
    """Draft a polite, empathetic customer service response addressing this issue."""

@generative
def translate(text: str, target_language: str) -> str:
    """Translate the text into the target language."""

def handle_ticket(m, feedback: str, language: str = "English") -> str:
    analysis = analyse_feedback(m, text=feedback)
    if not analysis.actionable:
        return "Logged for review."
    response = draft_response(m, issue=analysis.key_issue)
    if language != "English":
        response = translate(m, text=response, target_language=language)
    return str(response)

m = mellea.start_session()
print(handle_ticket(m, "The app crashes on login every time.", "French"))
```

```text Sample output
Cher(e) utilisateur valoré(e), nous sommes vraiment désolés de savoir
que vous rencontrez des problèmes de crash. Notre équipe travaille
activement à la résolution de ce problème et à l'amélioration de votre
expérience avec notre service. Nous vous remercions pour votre
compréhension et votre patience.
```

> **Note:** LLM output is non-deterministic. The response will be in French (or whichever target language you specify) and will vary in wording.

Each function is an independent LLM call. The composition logic stays in
ordinary Python.

## Step 4: Steer all functions via context

A key advantage of `@generative` functions over direct `instruct()` calls: you can
change the behaviour of every function in a session by injecting context once.

```python
# Requires: mellea
from mellea import generative, start_session
from mellea.stdlib.context import ChatContext
from mellea.core import CBlock

@generative
def grade_essay(essay: str) -> int:
    """Grade the essay and return a score from 1 to 100."""

@generative
def give_feedback(essay: str) -> list[str]:
    """Return a list of specific improvement suggestions for the essay."""

essay = "The cat sat on the mat. It was a nice mat. The cat liked it."

m = start_session(ctx=ChatContext())

# No context — grader decides independently.
grade = grade_essay(m, essay=essay)
feedback = give_feedback(m, essay=essay)
print(f"Grade: {grade}")
print(f"Feedback: {feedback}")

# Inject a persona — both functions now behave as this grader.
m.ctx = m.ctx.add(CBlock(
    "You are an encouraging primary school teacher. "
    "Keep grades above 70 unless there is a serious problem. "
    "Frame all feedback kindly."
))

grade = grade_essay(m, essay=essay)
feedback = give_feedback(m, essay=essay)
print(f"Grade with teacher context: {grade}")
print(f"Feedback with teacher context: {feedback}")

# Reset and try a different persona.
m.reset()
m.ctx = m.ctx.add(CBlock(
    "You are a grammar specialist. Focus entirely on sentence structure, "
    "punctuation, and vocabulary. Ignore content quality."
))

grade = grade_essay(m, essay=essay)
print(f"Grade with grammar context: {grade}")
```

```text Sample output
Grade: 85
Feedback: ['Add more descriptive language to make your writing more vivid.',
           'Include specific examples or details that support your point.',
           'Consider adding a thesis statement to clarify the argument.']
Grade with teacher context: 85
Feedback with teacher context: [
  'Add more descriptive language to make your writing more vivid.',
  'Include specific examples or details that support your point.',
  'Consider adding a thesis statement to clarify the argument.']
Grade with grammar context: 95
```

> **Note:** LLM output is non-deterministic. Output will vary.

`m.reset()` clears injected context while keeping the session and backend alive.

## Step 5: Pre- and postcondition validation

For production pipelines, validate inputs before the LLM call and outputs
afterwards using plain Python:

```python
# Requires: mellea
# Returns: None
from typing import Literal
from mellea import generative, start_session, MelleaSession

@generative
def analyse_client_profile(profile: str) -> dict:
    """Extract risk_tolerance, time_horizon, and liquidity_needs from the profile."""

@generative
def detect_prohibited_language(text: str) -> Literal["clean", "prohibited"]:
    """Detect whether the text contains phrases like 'guaranteed returns' or 'no risk'."""

@generative
def generate_advice_letter(profile: str) -> str:
    """Generate a personalised financial advice letter based on the client profile."""

def check_preconditions(analysis: dict) -> None:
    required = ["risk_tolerance", "time_horizon", "liquidity_needs"]
    missing = [f for f in required if not analysis.get(f)]
    if missing:
        raise ValueError(f"Incomplete profile — missing: {', '.join(missing)}")

def check_postconditions(letter: str, lang_flag: str) -> None:
    if lang_flag == "prohibited":
        raise ValueError("Letter contains prohibited compliance language.")
    if len(letter.split()) < 50:
        raise ValueError("Letter is too short to be a valid advice document.")

def render_advice(m: MelleaSession, profile: str) -> str:
    analysis = analyse_client_profile(m, profile=profile)
    check_preconditions(analysis)

    letter = generate_advice_letter(m, profile=profile)
    lang_flag = detect_prohibited_language(m, text=letter)
    check_postconditions(str(letter), str(lang_flag))

    return str(letter)

m = start_session()
profile = (
    "Client is 62, conservative risk tolerance, "
    "needs liquidity within 3 years, concerned about volatility."
)
try:
    print(render_advice(m, profile))
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Validation failed: {e}")
```

```text Sample output
Dear Client,

Given your age of 62 and a conservative risk tolerance, it's crucial
to maintain the stability of your investments while also ensuring you
can access funds within three years. Here are some steps we recommend:

1. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset
   classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate etc., to minimize risk.
2. **Liquidity**: Ensure a portion of your portfolio is in liquid
   assets or short-term bonds for easy access within the next 3 years.
3. **Volatility**: Consider investing in low-volatility funds or ETFs
   which can help mitigate the impact of market swings on your portfolio.
```

> **Note:** LLM output is non-deterministic. The letter will vary in wording but should be 50+ words and free of prohibited compliance language (`"guaranteed returns"`, `"no risk"`, etc.). If either check fails, you will see `Validation failed: ...` instead.

The precondition check runs before the expensive letter generation. The
postcondition check uses a second `@generative` call as a lightweight verifier.

## What you built

A pattern for replacing ad-hoc `instruct()` calls with reusable, typed,
context-steerable generative functions:

| Pattern | What it gives you |
| --- | --- |
| `@generative` with `Literal` return | Constrained output, no parsing |
| `@generative` with Pydantic return | Structured output, validated schema |
| Multiple `@generative` functions | Composable pipeline in plain Python |
| `ChatContext` + `CBlock` injection | Shared persona or policy across all functions |
| Pre/postcondition checks | Input validation and output compliance |
