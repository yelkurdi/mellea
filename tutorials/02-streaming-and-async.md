# diataxis: tutorial
---

In this tutorial you take the feedback analysis pipeline from Tutorial 01 and
make it production-ready: non-blocking async calls, token-by-token streaming to
a UI, and concurrent batch processing.

By the end you will have covered:

- `ainstruct()` and the async session method naming convention
- `ModelOption.STREAM` and `mot.astream()` for incremental output
- `wait_for_all_mots` for fan-out concurrent generation
- Context behaviour with concurrent async calls

**Prerequisites:** [Tutorial 01](./01-your-first-generative-program) complete,
`pip install mellea`, Ollama running locally with `granite4.1:3b` downloaded.

---

## Step 1: Your first async call

Every sync method on `MelleaSession` has an `a`-prefixed async counterpart with
the same signature and return type. Replace `instruct()` with `ainstruct()` and
wrap the call in `async def`:

```python
# Requires: mellea
# Returns: str
import asyncio
import mellea

async def main():
    m = mellea.start_session()
    result = await m.ainstruct(
        "Summarise this customer feedback in one sentence: "
        "The onboarding was confusing and took far too long. "
        "Support was helpful once I got through."
    )
    print(str(result))

asyncio.run(main())
```

```text Sample output
The customer experienced confusion during the initial setup process
which was time-consuming, but support was beneficial once connected.
```

> **Note:** LLM output is non-deterministic. Your result will vary in wording, but should be a single sentence.

`ainstruct()` returns a [`ModelOutputThunk`](../reference/glossary#modeloutputthunk). `await`-ing it starts generation
immediately; `str(result)` resolves the value when it is ready. Every other
method follows the same pattern: `achat()`, `aact()`, `aquery()`,
`atransform()`, `avalidate()`.

---

## Step 2: Streaming tokens

Enable streaming by passing `ModelOption.STREAM: True` in `model_options`.
Consume chunks with `mot.astream()` as they arrive — useful for displaying
output progressively rather than waiting for the full response:

```python
# Requires: mellea
# Returns: str
import asyncio
import mellea
from mellea.backends import ModelOption

async def stream_summary(feedback: str) -> str:
    m = mellea.start_session()
    mot = await m.ainstruct(
        "Summarise this customer feedback in one sentence: {{text}}",
        user_variables={"text": feedback},
        model_options={ModelOption.STREAM: True},
        strategy=None,
    )

    chunks = []
    while not mot.is_computed():
        chunk = await mot.astream()
        print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
        chunks.append(chunk)
    print()  # newline after streaming completes

    return "".join(chunks)

asyncio.run(stream_summary(
    "The onboarding was confusing and took far too long. "
    "Support was helpful once I got through."
))
```

```text Sample output
The customer found the onboarding process confusing and lengthy but
received good support assistance afterwards.
```

> **Note:** With streaming enabled, tokens print incrementally as they arrive. The example above shows the completed output. Your terminal will display each token as it is generated. LLM output is non-deterministic. Your result will vary in wording, but should be a single sentence.

How `astream()` works:

- Each call returns only the **new content** since the previous call.
- When generation is complete, `is_computed()` returns `True` and the final
  `astream()` call returns the remaining content.
- `strategy=None` is required to get a lazy thunk — without it, `ainstruct()` returns
  a pre-computed thunk and `is_computed()` is already `True` before the loop runs.
- Do not call `astream()` from multiple coroutines on the same thunk simultaneously.

---

## Step 3: Concurrent batch processing

The pipeline from Tutorial 01 processes one feedback item at a time, and each
call blocks until the previous one completes. With `ainstruct()` you can fire
all calls immediately and resolve them together.

Use `wait_for_all_mots` to await a list of thunks concurrently:

```python
# Requires: mellea
# Returns: list[str]
import asyncio
import mellea
from mellea.helpers.async_helpers import wait_for_all_mots

FEEDBACK_BATCH = [
    "The onboarding was confusing and took far too long. Support was helpful once I got through.",
    "Product works great but the mobile app crashes frequently. No response from support.",
    "Fast delivery, exactly as described. Will order again.",
    "Billing charged me twice. Still waiting for a refund after two weeks.",
]

async def summarise_batch(items: list[str]) -> list[str]:
    m = mellea.start_session()

    # Fire all summarisation calls immediately — none waits for the others.
    thunks = []
    for item in items:
        thunk = await m.ainstruct(
            "Summarise this customer feedback in one sentence: {{text}}",
            user_variables={"text": item},
        )
        thunks.append(thunk)

    # None are resolved yet — all are generating in parallel.
    await wait_for_all_mots(thunks)

    # All thunks are now resolved.
    return [t.value for t in thunks]

summaries = asyncio.run(summarise_batch(FEEDBACK_BATCH))
for summary in summaries:
    print(summary)
```

```text Sample output
The initial user experience was challenging with lengthy onboarding
process but the support team proved to be very helpful post-onboarding.
The product functions well; however, there are frequent issues with
the mobile app crashing, and user inquiries to the support team have
not been addressed.
The customer received fast, high-quality deliveries that matched their
expectations, indicating satisfaction with the service and willingness
to reorder.
The customer has been billed twice and is still awaiting a refund
despite the two-week duration.
```

> **Note:** LLM output is non-deterministic. You will see four summary lines, one per input, in the same order as `FEEDBACK_BATCH`.

The four requests are in flight simultaneously. Total wall-clock time is
roughly the latency of the slowest single call, rather than the sum of all four.

---

## Step 4: Mixing parallel and sequential steps

Some pipeline steps are independent; others depend on earlier results. You can
resolve dependencies explicitly without blocking unrelated work.

In the Tutorial 01 pipeline, `extract_issues` is independent of `summarize` —
both take the raw feedback. Run them in parallel, then feed the resolved summary
into `classify_sentiment`:

```python
# Requires: mellea
# Returns: None
import asyncio
from typing import Literal

import mellea
from mellea import generative
from mellea.helpers.async_helpers import wait_for_all_mots


@generative
def classify_sentiment(summary: str) -> Literal["positive", "negative", "mixed"]:
    """Classify the overall sentiment of the customer feedback summary."""


async def analyze_feedback(feedback: str) -> None:
    m = mellea.start_session()

    # Fire summarise and extract_issues in parallel — both take raw feedback.
    summary_thunk = await m.ainstruct(
        "Summarise this customer feedback in one sentence: {{text}}",
        user_variables={"text": feedback},
    )
    issues_thunk = await m.ainstruct(
        "Extract JSON with main_complaint, positive_aspect, and urgency from: {{text}}",
        user_variables={"text": feedback},
    )

    await wait_for_all_mots([summary_thunk, issues_thunk])

    summary = summary_thunk.value

    # classify_sentiment depends on the resolved summary — run it after.
    sentiment = classify_sentiment(m, summary=summary)

    print(f"Summary:   {summary}")
    print(f"Sentiment: {str(sentiment)}")
    print(f"Issues:    {issues_thunk.value}")


asyncio.run(analyze_feedback(
    "The onboarding was confusing and took far too long. "
    "Support was helpful once I got through."
))
```

```text Sample output
Summary:   The customer experienced confusion during the onboarding
           process which was lengthy, but support was beneficial
           upon successful navigation.
Sentiment: mixed
Issues:    {
  "main_complaint": "The onboarding process was confusing and time-consuming",
  "positive_aspect": "Support provided assistance once the user was
                      able to contact them",
  "urgency": "Medium"
}
```

> **Note:** LLM output is non-deterministic, your output may vary based on model and temperature.

---

## Step 5: Context and concurrency

By default [`start_session()`](../reference/glossary#melleasession) uses [`SimpleContext`](../reference/glossary#context), which is safe for concurrent
async calls. If you switch to [`ChatContext`](../reference/glossary#context), Mellea logs a warning because
concurrent writes can corrupt the context state:

```text
WARNING: Not using a SimpleContext with asynchronous requests could cause
unexpected results due to stale contexts. Ensure you await between requests.
```

> **Note:** This warning appears whenever `ChatContext` is used with async methods,
> even if you `await` each call sequentially. It is safe to ignore when you ensure
> each call is fully resolved before starting the next.

If you need `ChatContext` (for multi-turn conversation), await each call before
starting the next:

```python
# Requires: mellea
# Returns: None
import asyncio
import mellea
from mellea.stdlib.context import ChatContext

async def sequential_chat():
    m = mellea.start_session(ctx=ChatContext())
    r1 = await m.achat("Hello.")
    r2 = await m.achat("Tell me more.")  # safe — r1 is fully resolved
    print(str(r2))

asyncio.run(sequential_chat())
```

```text Sample output

```

> **Note:** LLM output is non-deterministic. Your result will vary in wording.

For parallel generation, keep the default `SimpleContext`.

## What you built

| Pattern | What it gives you |
| --- | --- |
| `ainstruct()` / `achat()` / `aact()` | Non-blocking LLM calls |
| `ModelOption.STREAM` + `astream()` | Token-by-token output for responsive UIs |
| `wait_for_all_mots` | Fan-out: all thunks resolve concurrently |
| Explicit dependency ordering | Sequential where needed, parallel everywhere else |
| `SimpleContext` (default) | Safe concurrent access with no state corruption |
